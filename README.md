# Pokepy-Controller
A Python-based controller for first generation Pokémon games on an emulator, using opencv2 and pyautogui
# Working
This program triggers an event when it is your turn to play during a battle in Pokémon games. As it is currently in beta phase, the program only provides the names of the two Pokémon, their levels, and the HP of your Pokémon. No further information is available at the moment, and you have the option to choose between four attacks and fleeing. More features are coming soon.
